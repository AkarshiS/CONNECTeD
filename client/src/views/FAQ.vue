        <i><p style="color:seagreen"> Q: I'm a University of Toronto student. Why should I use CONNECTeD?</p></i>
        A: Say you know how to use powerful tools like Python, Java, and R. Perhaps you want to combine those tools
        with hobbies or side interests. If there's something (anything!) you've been meaning to create, you can trust our platform to find collaborators and turn dream projects
        into finished products.

        <i><p style="color:seagreen"> Q: This is so cool. I made an account. Now how do I go about making project partners?</p></i>
        A: Simply assign profile tags to yourself for languages, frameworks, and technologies you're familiar with. Then, you can use the
        search bar to view other users and their abilities, as well as current projects underway. To connect with people and projects,
        simply navigate to their cards. Have fun!
