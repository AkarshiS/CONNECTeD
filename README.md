## Introduction

ConnectEd is an online platform where university students can turn dream projects into finished products. 
Our platform matches UofT students based on self-stated personal objectives, skill levels, and project ideas. Students can connect, collaborate, and hone entrepreneurial and preprofessional skills as they complete projects with other nominated users.
